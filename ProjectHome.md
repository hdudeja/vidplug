VidPlug is a small but powerful non-linear video editor for GNU/Linux, designed to be easy to use for small to medium video projects (perfect for online video sharing sites).

VidPlug does not attempt to be a fully fledged professional video editor, rather to allow quick splicing, arrangement, transcoding and other effects.
